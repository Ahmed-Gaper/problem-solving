# Problem Solving Roadmap

Welcome to my Problem Solving Roadmap repository! This repository documents the structured approach I follow
 to master data structures and algorithms. It serves as a guide to my learning journey, outlining the courses, 
 problem sheets, and my LeetCode practice that shape my progress. While it doesn't contain full submissions, 
 it will include dedicated topic files (e.g., Graph, Binary Tree) that list `key problems` and link to my solutions.

## Online Problem Solving

I focus my problem-solving practice now on LeetCode:

## Overview

My learning journey is inspired by the methodology in Mostafa Saad's algorithms courses on Udemy. I have completed:
- **[Mastering Critical SKILLS in Data Structures using C++](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-a185868b-af7e-4b6c-913d-e82656cd8c2a/)**
- **[Mastering Critical SKILLS in Algorithms using C++: Part 1](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-9ecc7e92-e5ef-42a6-a248-55a87fcd46d2/)**
- **[Mastering Critical SKILLS in Algorithms using C++: Part 2]([#](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-algorithms-cpp2/?couponCode=ST9MT120225B))** *(In Progress)*

I am currently taking **Mastering Critical SKILLS in Algorithms using C++: Part 2**.  
In addition, I reinforce my understanding by solving problems from curated sheets like - **[SheetStriver](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)**, with my primary practice platform being `LeetCode Daily Streak`.

## The Roadmap

My roadmap is structured in stages to build a strong foundation and progress to advanced topics:

1. **Foundations:**
   - Basics of C++ and core programming concepts.
   - Fundamental Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues).

2. **Intermediate Topics:**
   - Advanced Data Structures (trees, graphs, heaps).
   - Essential algorithm paradigms (greedy algorithms, recursion, sorting, and searching).

3. **Advanced Concepts:**
   - In-depth algorithm analysis and optimization.
   - Dynamic programming and backtracking.
   - Real-world problem-solving strategies.

4. **Online Problem Solving:**
   - Regular practice on LeetCode.
   - Focus on conceptual clarity and effective problem-solving techniques.

For detailed timelines and milestones, refer to my internal notes in this repository.

## Topic Files Template

To organize my learning further, I plan to create a separate file for each topic (e.g., Graph, Binary Tree, Dynamic Programming). Each topic file will contain a curated list of problems, links to the problem statements, my solution links, and key insights or takeaways.

### Example Template for a Topic File (e.g., `Graph.md`):

```markdown
# Graph Problems

This file contains a curated list of graph-related problems that I have solved on LeetCode.
